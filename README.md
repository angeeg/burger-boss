# burger-boss

## WHAT
A fun, fast paced cooking game where one will be challenged against to clock to assemble and serve burgers to order. Whichever player earns the highest score, AKA can make the most burgers the fastest, will be crowned the BURGER BOSS. 

## WHY
Cooking games were always my go to. Fighting? Taking a quest? I didn't have much patience or interest for those. But give me a task, an order to fulfill, and FOOD!? Sold. So the creation of Burger Boss began.
